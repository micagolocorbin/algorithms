# 🧩 Algorithms Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to coding interview problems from **[AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/)**.  
The goal is to practice and document solutions across multiple programming languages:

- 💧 Elixir  
- 🐹 Go  
- 🐍 Python  
- 🟦 TypeScript  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each problem will have its own folder, containing solutions in all supported languages.

├── problem-name/
│ └── elixir/
│ └── solution.exs
│ ├── go/
│ │ └── solution.go
│ ├── python/
│ │ └── solution.py
│ ├── typescript/
│ │ └── solution.ts

## 🚀 How to Run

### Elixir

```bash
cd problem-name/elixir
elixir solution.exs
```

### Go

```bash
cd problem-name/go
go run solution.go
```

### Python

```bash
cd problem-name/python
python solution.py
```

### TypeScript

```bash
cd problem-name/typescript
tsc solution.ts
```

## 📊 Progress Tracker
